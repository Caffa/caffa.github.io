      <description>Status This is the script for my meta-template picker video Obsidian: Building the Meta-Templater from Scratch - YouTube.
Currently working on this blog post
Post Today I want to share, how to use a meta-templater in your workflow
so first, What is the meta-templater
(what it does - trigger template based on name of the file) Bryan Jenks
Bryan Jenks first coined this term, he adds this symbol in front of his links so it tells obsidian what kind of note this is supposed to be, so example a book source note.</description>
