      <description>So currently, I learn things via
theory break it down beginner guides how other people use this thing (e.g. da vinci resolve tips and training videos) practice try a small project (e.g. renpy visual novels) create something cute / useful (e.g. bitbar script for youtube stats) memorization anki - spaced repetition (the videos on how to do anki efficiently by med students using AnKing Deck are chef&amp;rsquo;s kiss) useful for things that are just lots of information and definitions when you need a lot of basic info to understand what you are reading (papers) also for remembering summaries of papers (so I can discuss with other people in my lab) As a way to revisit zettels (there are a few different ways to &amp;lsquo;see random note&amp;rsquo; or export from obsidian to anki) </description>

      <description>Intro If you work from home then you probably have tried to work in bed before :) but it is rather uncomfortable with a tiny laptop and suspending an actual monitor right above my face is a bit scary (it might drop&amp;hellip; directly onto my head) so my current solution is: a projector!
Downsides of a projector? It is super loud.
Basic Setup You need:
a projector (hdmi input) that is hopefully not too loud some computer (can be headless like the mac mini) if the computer does not have a hdmi slot then you also need a dongle mouse or even a trackball split keyboard (two parts of keyboard attached by cable) cables computer to projector (hdmi to hdmi) keyboard to computer (USB C to USB C for moonlander) - this needs to be a long cable (1.</description>

‚ÄúLaziness is the mother of all bad habits, but ultimately she is a mother and we should respect her‚Äù - Shikamaru Nara
&amp;ldquo;Failure is the mother of success&amp;rdquo; is a common saying and from my experiences it seems pretty true that we learn best from experimenting and trying out things for ourselves bz-we learn best from doing - especially from our mistakes (because we remember better and actually understand) - see I hear and I forget.</description>

      <description>Source People often don&amp;rsquo;t know what frame they want for the family portrait, so they go to the shop and the assistant will put up various different frames against the picture so you can see what it looks like. Then people are able to voice their preferences like &amp;ldquo;not this one, but similar, I want a lighter wood frame&amp;rdquo;

Reflection We often think that we don&amp;rsquo;t have preferences or opinions on something until we actually encounter the topic and interact with it (able to frame it in our head), then we have loads of opinions.</description>

      <description>source:: A note blog by Alexkehayias - Reflections on Two Years of Note Blogging
About What is note blogging?
The idea that you should publish the notes you are writing instead of waiting for them to become fully formed blog posts.
Reflections I like this practice because I often take a lot of notes on a topic but then never actually get to publishing the blogpost / video because getting something to &amp;lsquo;production ready&amp;rsquo; is really hard.</description>

      <title>rubber ducky problem solving</title>

      <guid>https://caffa.github.io/zettels/z-rubber-ducky-problem-solving/</guid>
      <description>source::
A way programmers problem solve (try to understand why their code is not working) is to explain the problem to a rubber ducky, because the process of explaining to &amp;ldquo;someone&amp;rdquo; really helps find issues that we mentally brush over when we explain to ourselves (because we assume that we know everything about it already).
Hence we should z-express to think through the idea and z-write for other people in order to be better thinkers, you dont think in your head you only think when you actually express the idea.</description>

      <description>Status This is the script for my meta-template picker video Obsidian: Building the Meta-Templater from Scratch - YouTube.
Currently working on this blog post
Post Today I want to share, how to use a meta-templater in your workflow
so first, What is the meta-templater
(what it does - trigger template based on name of the file) Bryan Jenks
Bryan Jenks first coined this term, he adds this symbol in front of his links so it tells obsidian what kind of note this is supposed to be, so example a book source note.</description>
