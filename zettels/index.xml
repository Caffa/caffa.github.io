Calendar-Priority Alignment “What are your priorities?” “If I look at your calendar, would it be obvious to me that those are your priorities?” Hack: Use your Calendar as your to-do list so that your highest priority to-dos actually get done.
Key Idea You want to allocate your time according to your priorities. You can do this by Time-blocking where you create calendar events for each todo you want to do (usually for a week), this means that you set when you will do the thing and how long it will take.</description>
