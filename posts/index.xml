      <description>So currently, I learn things via
theory break it down beginner guides how other people use this thing (e.g. da vinci resolve tips and training videos) practice try a small project (e.g. renpy visual novels) create something cute / useful (e.g. bitbar script for youtube stats) memorization anki - spaced repetition (the videos on how to do anki efficiently by med students using AnKing Deck are chef&amp;rsquo;s kiss) useful for things that are just lots of information and definitions when you need a lot of basic info to understand what you are reading (papers) also for remembering summaries of papers (so I can discuss with other people in my lab) As a way to revisit zettels (there are a few different ways to &amp;lsquo;see random note&amp;rsquo; or export from obsidian to anki) </description>

      <description>Intro If you work from home then you probably have tried to work in bed before :) but it is rather uncomfortable with a tiny laptop and suspending an actual monitor right above my face is a bit scary (it might drop&amp;hellip; directly onto my head) so my current solution is: a projector!

      <description>Status This is the script for my meta-template picker video Obsidian: Building the Meta-Templater from Scratch - YouTube.
Currently working on this blog post
Post Today I want to share, how to use a meta-templater in your workflow
so first, What is the meta-templater
(what it does - trigger template based on name of the file) Bryan Jenks
Bryan Jenks first coined this term, he adds this symbol in front of his links so it tells obsidian what kind of note this is supposed to be, so example a book source note.</description>
