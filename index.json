So that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to remember and fill metadata (to reduce friction, effort and the chance you forget to tag the correct metadata. And like for people with a folder system, this means you don\u0026rsquo;t have to manually drag the file to the correct nested folder). This means you have the default status, metadata, headings, default tasks and rollup fields that you want for that specific page type. and then you can have dashboards that automatically index and organize your system for a bottom up system!\nYou can know what kind of page the link is even before you click it with your naming convention, have phrases that trigger prompts and templates that automatically rename and date your files. This also makes it easy to find links by searching for the page type then specifics.\nIntro Hi y\u0026rsquo;all, welcome back to the channel. If you\u0026rsquo;re new here, my name\u0026rsquo;s Pamela. I\u0026rsquo;m a graduate student in Singapore, and on this channel, we share ways to implement productivity systems that help us live relaxed potato life.\nToday, I\u0026rsquo;ll be going over my version of the meta-templater.\nValue Credits to Bryan Jenk\u0026rsquo;s Meta-Templater which inspired mine. He uses symbols to trigger his templates using the same meta-templater concept. Link to his video in the description below.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like having symbols in my title and with symbols you are limited to a certain amount of characters you can use (based on what OS system you have). Like these are what you can use for mac. So I expanded upon his meta-templater to capture the phrase in front of a dash character instead. I also want to use a short phrase to trigger the template and maybe more than one phrase should trigger the same template, but I don\u0026rsquo;t like having weird abbreviations in front of my note titles. You might be like wait what, you can\u0026rsquo;t just rename manually? Well it\u0026rsquo;s just kinda introduces friction into my workflow and so I rename the template and move it at the same time, and this causes a little bug but I will tell you how to fix it later.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about how this meta-templater works. First you want to ensure that your default notes folder is the same one that you are going to use for the meta-templater folder template trigger. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter which folder because you can get templater to move and rename your files later. So I just pick this, and do the same here in templater.\nNow we need the meta-templater picker template, it has to be in your templates folder that you define in the templater plugin.\nThe first part of the code basically defines what to do if there is no trigger phrase. Which is use the default note template. This is really convenient because there will always be some new application that you don\u0026rsquo;t have a template for.\nSo this is the important line of my meta-templater finds the trigger phrase by splitting it anywhere there is a dash, and then taking the first portion which I call the trigger phrase. The templater plugin is basically going line by line through this and will take the first template that fits, so it is super important to ensure that your longer phrases are on top, and just generally design, your naming convention so there are as little overlap as possible. If you are interested, comment below and I\u0026rsquo;ll make a video on naming conventions. I have a basic one on my tagging conventions already up :)\nBut here is a little peek into my upgraded naming-tagging conventions that I am still ironing out the kinks for. Basically I have switched to using tags for metadata like page type, page status, which mode (area) of my life. This helps add clarity and I can use emojis! Because you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t use emoji\u0026rsquo;s in the file name if you want to sync with dropbox so I don\u0026rsquo;t use them in links but tags are fine.\nMake templates for the page types that you use the most. Eventually it can be all the page types you use.\nFor example, I have templates for youtube videos, my zettelkasten system (inspired by my Ali Abdaal\u0026rsquo;s Notion Youtube Template and Beau Hann\u0026rsquo;s Zettelkasten system from Roam Book Club 4 - Day 29). Tip 1: You can control if the tasks show up in your task rollups with this indentation trick where you put the bullet under text instead of another bullet - If you wanna use rollups more effectively, I\u0026rsquo;m working on a comprehensive guide to 3 types of dataview rollups this week, it\u0026rsquo;ll be here once it\u0026rsquo;s done YT Video - Comprehensive Guide - How to do dataview rollups in obsidian for that.\nThe most basic version of the meta-templater is just (trigger-name of file). When you click on it, the template opens. You can add functionality by auto renaming and moving to a different file. I basically extract the name of file removing the trigger phrase, then add back like the file type and maybe a date if it is the kind of note that has versions. It can even fill in dataview tables for you! You put the title in dataview tables and then (you can search for everything that calls this note, if this note is supposed to be a page tracker)\nYou have to put the await before renaming or it won\u0026rsquo;t work. Moving is essentially like changing the path + renaming. You can keep the title if you want but I definitely don\u0026rsquo;t reccommend it because then it would be super weird if you call the same template with different trigger phrases (for example, I use both reflect and think for my journalling reflection templates)\nTip 3: The renaming moving function can cause these empty templates with the original name of the file, get the \u0026ldquo;File Cleaner\u0026rdquo; plugin and just click on the trash icon to clear them away.\nMore advanced is a dataview prompt in your meta-templater, credit to Komma from the forums for the snippet I based this on and links to Templater documentation below. So I have prompts for my zettelkasten, and this allows me to just define the kind of sub-note type it is under like all possible types of zettels I could have had. I also do this for meeting notes (I have a few fixed type of meetings) and source notes (which is like all my reading notes).\nYou have the include the prompt note in your meta template picker and then instead of a template, you have more templater code in the prompt note.\nTip 2: open this in a code editor where you can see the code syntax instead of squinting at obsidian. I am using sublime text here with the javascript syntax coloring.\nYou can just have two of the same list here, this is what you see and what it defines the filetype variable into. The filetype variable is basically the trigger phrase. Then false says that you don\u0026rsquo;t want to throw an error if you quit the prompt instead of pressing one of the templates. Then the last string is just what you want it to show.\nThen the code below is basically the same as the meta-templater picker, where templater picks based on the trigger phrase. This is kinda like a nested meta-template picker but good for when you vaguely remember the category - this is a reading note or a zettel etc but like don\u0026rsquo;t want to interupt your thinking for metadata clarification.\nTip 3: see these dashes? they are used to remove white space and like crucially importantly to avoid the weird blank line of white space before your actual template content.\nOk so what kind of templates to have?\nFirstly, I recomend that you have a tester template phrase for testing cool new template stuff, and when you are making your own meta picker, you can just use the tester template as your default so everytime you press new file, you can test whether your changes are working.\nSecondly, put your default inline dataview fields for page property in your default note. You can even have a template for templates :) Do remember to move all the templates you make for the meta-templater into the templater templates folder.\nDescription Hi!

End of the Week (Friday or Sunday): Do your weekly review (in this week\u0026rsquo;s weekly note) and this means checking what you have done this week, reflecting on it, collecting todos that you want to finish doing, and checking what needs to be done for next week. Write summaries for this week based on the daily log rollups. Plan what you need to do for next week in terms of tasks and events. Timeblock in your calendar. End of the Month (Last week of the month): Do a monthly review for the month that has passed. This is more of like overarching goals you want to achieve e.g. I want to focus on Health this month (I usually pick from a prioritized list from my annual reflections), what you have done this month (rolls up from weekly summaries ‚Üí monthly summaries) and check your monthly trigger list (GTD concept - list of things you might want to do things for). Why you might want this:\nFeels good. It relieves the mental burden of constantly planning what to do and worrying that you are missing something. It helps you work towards your goals as you are being intentional with how you spend your time.
