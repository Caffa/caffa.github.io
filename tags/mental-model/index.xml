Definition “If you can’t measure it you can’t improve it.” Peter Drucker
You need to track the things you want to work on, not just rely on a sense that &amp;ldquo;ehh I am getting healthier&amp;rdquo;
Tracking things makes you subconsciously change your behaviour? (TODO find that article about how weighing self everyday makes people adjust their food intake) You don&amp;rsquo;t really know unless you take the scientific approach: eliminate other variables as much as possible, repeatedly test (with a control) and see if the effect is repeated.</description>
